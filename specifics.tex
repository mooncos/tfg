$R_{\max}$ and $\nu_{r\max}$ depend on the environment and the case of radar use. In the context of measuring the gait of a person, the environment is indoors and the target is a walking human being. The target linear velocity should be around $\SI{5}{\kilo\meter\per\hour} \approx \SI{1.4}{\meter\per\second}$. The goal is to obtain measurements from moving parts of the body. The fastest moving parts are the arms, which have a maximum radial velocity of around \SI{3}{\meter\per\second}. Therefore, $\nu_{r\max} = 1.4 + 3 = \SI{4.4}{\meter\per\second}$. A margin of error is left to avoid measurement errors from sudden movements of body parts. Thus, $\nu_{r\max} =\SI{5.9}{\meter\per\second}$.



With these constraints, it is possible to obtain the minimum sampling frequencies and the maximum pulse repetition intervals for radars with different bandwidths and working frequencies by solving \cref{eq:fs_final}. A series of examples are shown in \cref{tab:fs_Tc}.

For the purpose of this Bachelor Thesis, the measurement and operation of the system is carried out under the following conditions:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:if_conditions}
	f_0 = \SI{24}{\giga\hertz} \qquad W = \SI{2}{\giga\hertz} \qquad f_{s\min} = \SI{0.5}{\mega\hertz} \qquad T_c = \SI{529.7}{\micro\second}
\end{equation}

This yields the following maximum operating range ($R_{\max}$):
\begin{align}
	f_s c^2 &= 16 R_{\max}W f_0 \nu_{r\max} \\
	R_{\max} &= \frac{f_s c^2}{16 W f_0 \nu_{r\max}} = \SI{9.917}{\meter}
\end{align}
which is sufficient for an indoor environment of operation requiring around \SI{10}{\meter} distance maximum.
